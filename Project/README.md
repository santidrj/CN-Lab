# CN Project
This folder contains the code and auxiliary files to run the different experiments presented in the paper.

In the `output` folder you will find the plots used in the paper as well as the `.clu` file with the communities detected.

We also provide a `requirements.txt` file to install all the required dependencies.

If you want to run the scripts in a Winows machine we have uploaded some of the required dependencies, that are not available through the standard channels, to a [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E9rmYlf3SQu0EHxEuOhun7PnDkCiONZF). In this folder you will also find two dictionaries used in the `small_world_main.py` script. These dictionaries need to be in the `output` directory before running the script.
